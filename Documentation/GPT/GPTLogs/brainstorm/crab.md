**You:**

Help me brainstorm the unlock or tech tree for a game that allows you to play a character that starts a crab fishing business that starts with one rusty crab trap used from the edge of a rickety dock, and ends up unlocking on land transportation carts to haul gear and crab to and from better docks, better Fishing methods (bait, knowledge of tides and crab locations) and eventually boats with many traps.

**ChatGPT:**

Sure! Hereâ€™s a brainstorm for a tech tree for your crab fishing game, starting from a single rusty crab trap to a full-fledged crab fishing business:

### Starting Point

* **Rusty Crab Trap:** The initial equipment used from a rickety dock.

### First Tier: Basic Upgrades

1. **Basic Crab Traps:** Slightly better traps that catch more crabs.
2. **Simple Bait:** Improve bait to attract more crabs.
3. **Tide Charts:** Learn basic knowledge of tides to optimize fishing times.

### Second Tier: Intermediate Equipment and Knowledge

1. **Better Crab Traps:** Upgrade to more durable traps with a higher catch rate.
2. **Advanced Bait:** Use more effective bait that significantly increases the catch.
3. **Crab Locations Map:** Develop a basic map indicating common crab locations.

### Third Tier: Transportation and Infrastructure

1. **Hand Cart:** Small, manual cart to transport gear and catch from the dock.
2. **Improved Dock:** Upgrade to a more stable and larger dock for better fishing.
3. **Fishing Shed:** Small storage shed on the dock for storing traps and bait.

### Fourth Tier: Advanced Fishing Techniques

1. **Knowledge of Seasons:** Detailed understanding of crab seasons to maximize yield.
2. **Multiple Traps:** Ability to set and manage multiple traps at once.
3. **Better Fishing Methods:** Advanced techniques for checking and resetting traps efficiently.

### Fifth Tier: Motorized Equipment and Logistics

1. **Motorized Cart:** Upgrade to a motorized cart for faster transportation of gear and catch.
2. **Crab Sorting Station:** A station for sorting and processing crabs at the dock.
3. **Supply Contracts:** Establish contracts with bait suppliers for regular deliveries.

### Sixth Tier: Small Boats and Off-Shore Fishing

1. **Rowboat:** Basic boat for fishing slightly offshore.
2. **Off-Shore Crab Traps:** Specialized traps for deeper water.
3. **GPS Navigation:** Use GPS to find the best fishing spots and navigate safely.

### Seventh Tier: Professional-Grade Equipment

1. **Fishing Boat:** Larger, more capable boat for significant off-shore operations.
2. **Automated Traps:** Traps that can be remotely monitored and managed.
3. **Onboard Processing:** Equipment on the boat to process and store crabs while at sea.

### Eighth Tier: Large-Scale Operations

1. **Fleet of Boats:** Ability to manage multiple boats for extensive fishing operations.
2. **Crab Distribution Network:** Develop a network for distributing crabs to various markets.
3. **Advanced Sonar:** Use sonar technology to locate large populations of crabs.

### Ninth Tier: Business Expansion and Management

1. **Crab Fishing HQ:** Central headquarters for managing operations.
2. **Research and Development:** Invest in R&D for better traps, bait, and techniques.
3. **Sustainability Practices:** Implement sustainable fishing practices to ensure long-term viability.

### Tenth Tier: Ultimate Unlocks

1. **Crab Fishing Empire:** Establish a dominant position in the crab fishing industry.
2. **Luxury Fishing Yacht:** For personal use or high-end crab fishing experiences.
3. **Global Distribution:** Expand your market reach internationally.

This tech tree outlines a progression from a humble start to a comprehensive crab fishing business, incorporating equipment upgrades, knowledge advancements, and business expansion.
