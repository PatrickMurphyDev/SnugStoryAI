### Writing Fictional Stories Tips


**A Story's Core Elements:**
- A story explores how external events affect a character trying to achieve a difficult goal and how they change internally as a result.
- Determine what each character wants. What is their goal? Ensure they actively pursue these goals.
- Characters should have overarching story goals and smaller goals in each scene that bring them closer to their main objective. For example, in a murder mystery, a detective’s main goal is to solve the murder, but in a scene, they might be searching for a clue or connecting with a witness. These smaller goals should drive change in the character, either boosting their confidence or causing setbacks that force them to react and push the plot forward.


**Character Development:**
1. **Initial Desire:**
   - What does your character want before the story begins? How does the inciting incident change their desires?


2. **Motivation:**
   - What drives your character to pursue their goal despite hardships? Keep asking "why" until you can't anymore.


3. **Goal Significance:**
   - What will achieving this goal mean to your character? How will it affect their life?


4. **Obstacles:**
   - What stands in your character's way externally? This could be an antagonist or a force like a storm.
   - Internal conflicts arise from within the character, such as self-doubt, addiction, fear, or lack of knowledge.


5. **Internal Conflict:**
   - How does the character’s backstory influence their internal conflicts? These conflicts should be overcome gradually throughout the story.


6. **Consequences:**
   - What does your character have to lose or gain? What’s at stake in achieving their goal?
