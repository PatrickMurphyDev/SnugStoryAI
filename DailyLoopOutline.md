- **Start of the Day**
    
    - Player wakes up with a status reflecting their current health (hunger, thirst, energy).
    - A brief forecast (weather and tide conditions) is displayed, influencing crabbing success.
    - Optional morning interactions with NPCs who offer hints, jobs, or gossip (some could be related to the cult subplot).
- **Preparation Phase**
    
    - **Supplies**:
        - Purchase bait, traps, food, and water in Asbury’s Reef.
        - Scavenge around the island for free resources (e.g., discarded traps, driftwood for repairs).
    - **Equipment**:
        - Repair gear or boat parts if materials and funds allow.
        - Upgrade traps for better efficiency.
    - **Hire Crew**:
        - Talk to NPCs to find available crew members if the boat is seaworthy. Different crew members have varying skills and trust levels (some might have ties to the cult).
    - **Side Jobs**:
        - Work on a harbor boat for a wage if their boat isn’t operational.
        - Help locals with tasks to earn money, supplies, or gain their trust.
- **Voyage or Dockside Crabbing**
    
    - **Dockside Crabbing**:
        - Limited, low-risk crabbing. Drop and collect traps along the docks.
        - Minimal earnings but reliable when the player lacks equipment or energy.
    - **Voyaging to Sea** (if the boat is functional):
        - Set sail to different zones (nearshore, mid-depth, or deep sea).
        - Deploy traps and wait for crabs to accumulate, balancing time and resources.
        - Manage random events (weather changes, trap damage, encounters with hostile wildlife or suspicious characters).
        - Return to port before exhaustion or risk penalties (e.g., losing a day due to passing out or sinking the boat).
- **Return to Island**
    
    - Sell crabs at the market (prices fluctuate based on demand and competition).
    - Allocate funds between debt repayment, upgrades, supplies, and crew wages.
    - Explore and socialize:
        - Build relationships with townsfolk (unlock quests, rumors, or potential alliances).
        - Learn more about the island’s mysteries and the cult through conversations or eavesdropping.
- **Evening Activities**
    
    - Prepare for the next day or unwind:
        - Repair equipment or traps, cook meals, or participate in local events.
        - Investigate cult-related activities or venture into suspicious areas for clues (risks involve losing time or raising suspicion).
    - Risk/Reward System:
        - Staying up too late results in penalties the next day (low energy, higher hunger).
